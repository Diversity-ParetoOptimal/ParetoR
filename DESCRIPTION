Description: Estimates Pareto-Optimal solution for diversity hiring by providing a series of Pareto-optimal solutions that simultaneously optimize both diversity and criterion validity in a personnel selection scenario [see Song, Wee, & Newman (2017)]. The current package allows for implementation of three Pareto-optimization approaches. (1) Pareto-optimal method that was adapted from De Corte, Lievens & Sackett (2007); (2) Pareto-optimal shrinkage formulae to estimate formula-adjusted shrunken Pareto-optimal solutions [see Study 1 of Song, Tang, Newman, & Wee (2023)]; (3) regularized Pareto-optimal method [see Study 2 of Song, Tang, Newman, & Wee (2023)].
